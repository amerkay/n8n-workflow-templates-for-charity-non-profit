## How to import workflows

You can import it to your n8n account from the dot-menu on the upper right hand side: 
![n8n Import Workflow from JSON](./public/n8n-import-workflow-from-json.png)

> Keep in mind, subflow IDs will be different, so you will need to update these to the correct subflows in the two main workflows.
